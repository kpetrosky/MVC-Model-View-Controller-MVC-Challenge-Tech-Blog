# MVC-Model-View-Controller-MVC-Challenge-Tech-Blog



## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation and the why of why I built the project are very similar. I really struggled with all the moving parts of MVC, specifically how the handlebars connect or talk to other parts of the backend. If a person plans to work in the backend of development, you have to understand all the moving parts.
The problem that it solved was making a tech blog. 

I learned about the moving parts, and now know more of the parts.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
