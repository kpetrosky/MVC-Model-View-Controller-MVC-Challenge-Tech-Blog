# MVC-Model-View-Controller-MVC-Challenge-Tech-Blog



## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation and the why of why I built the project are very similar. I really struggled with all the moving parts of MVC, specifically how the handlebars connect or talk to other parts of the backend. If a person plans to work in the backend of development, you have to understand all the moving parts.
The problem that it solved was making a tech blog. 

I learned about the moving parts, and now know more of the parts.
